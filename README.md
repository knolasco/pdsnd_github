# BikeShare Project
The purpose of this repository is to share the project completed for the Udacity Data Science Nano-Degree.

- bikeshare.py

This file will display statistics for three bikeshare datasets. The cities used in this analysis are include New York, Chicago, and Washington. The script gives the user the option to choose from 3 different ways of viewing the data: Comparing Volume by City, Determining High and Low Traffic Times, and Comparing Volume by User Type. The script then gives the user a choice for which cities to focus on; the user can choose two cities to compare, or all cities. Finally, the script asks the user how they would like to aggregate the data: by day, week or month. The script will then compute the necessary stats in the backend, and print the first 5 rows of the output to the user. The user then has the option to view 5 more or not. Once the user has finished viewing the raw data, the script asks the user if they would like to see a visualization of the data. Once the user closes the visualization, the process begins from the beginning. At any time, the user can type "None" to exit out of the loop.
